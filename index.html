    <p>
       I am a proud student of National Institute of Technology at Raipur .
       Currently I am in mininig branch , but I am not interested in mininig at all .These mining techniques are not at all innovative and there is not much thinking about the course  people just learn all the things in a rote learning fashion .
       This is anaklogous to what we eat before the examinations and puke it in the examinations and forgot all the things after the conduction of exams thats all .
